MACHINE LEARNING
	
	* FEATURES
	  -Features are those properties of a problem based on which you would like to predict results.
	  -For example,
		 ~In image processing, features can be gradient magnitude, color, grayscale intensity, edges, areas, and more. 
	 	 ~In speech recognition, features can be sound lengths, noise level, noise ratios, and more.
	 	 ~In spam-fighting initiatives, features are abundant. They can be IP location, text structure, frequency of certain words, or certain email headers

	* TYPES
	  1.Supervised Learning: We have instances of any target or outcome variable to predict. 
		~COMMON ALGOS:  -Nearest Neighbor
			        -Naive Bayes
			        -Decision Trees
				-Linear Regression
				-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	  2.Unsupervised Learning: We do not have any target or outcome variable to predict.
				-K-means
				-Hierarchical Clustering(Divisive, Agglomerative)
	  3.Semi-supervised Learning: Combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, typically containing a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

DEEP LEARNING
	
	~ Deep learning algorithms heavily depend on high-end machines, so the basic requirements of deep learning algorithm include GPUs.
	~ Deep learning algorithms try to learn high-level features from data.
	~ When solving a problem using traditional machine learning algorithm, it is generally recommended to break the problem down into different parts, solve them individually and combine them to get the result. 
		Deep learning in contrast advocates to solve the problem end-to-end.
	~ Deep learning algorithms takes a long time to train.
	~ It is particularly difficult to interpret the reasoning behind results of deep learning algorithms.

	-Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)
	-Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
	-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
	-Stacked Auto-Encoders
