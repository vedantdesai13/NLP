MACHINE LEARNING
	
	* FEATURES
	  -Features are those properties of a problem based on which you would like to predict results.
	  -For example,
		 ~In image processing, features can be gradient magnitude, color, grayscale intensity, edges, areas, and more. 
	 	 ~In speech recognition, features can be sound lengths, noise level, noise ratios, and more.
	 	 ~In spam-fighting initiatives, features are abundant. They can be IP location, text structure, frequency of certain words, or certain email headers

	* TYPES
	  1.Supervised Learning: We have instances of any target or outcome variable to predict. 
		~COMMON ALGOS:  -Nearest Neighbor
			        -Naive Bayes
			        -Decision Trees
				-Linear Regression
				-Support Vector Machines (SVM)
	  2.Unsupervised Learning: We do not have any target or outcome variable to predict. It is also called as clustering.
				-K-means
				-Hierarchical Clustering(Divisive, Agglomerative)
	  3.Semi-supervised Learning: Combination of supervised and unsupervised learning, typically containing a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data.

	 -> Classification:- Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. So the computer program learns from the data input given to it and then uses this learning to classify new observation.
			  Common algos used:- Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree,  Random Forest,  Support Vector Machine. 
	 -> Regression:- It is the process of predicting values of a desired target quantity when the target quantity is continuous.
			   Common algos used:- Simple linear regression, Support vector machines, multivariate regression algorithm.

DEEP LEARNING
	
	~ Deep learning algorithms heavily depend on high-end machines, so the basic requirements of deep learning algorithm include GPUs.
	~ Deep learning algorithms try to learn high-level features from data.
	~ When solving a problem using traditional machine learning algorithm, it is generally recommended to break the problem down into different parts, solve them individually and combine them to get the result. 
		Deep learning in contrast advocates to solve the problem end-to-end.
	~ Deep learning algorithms takes a long time to train.
	~ It is particularly difficult to interpret the reasoning behind results of deep learning algorithms.
